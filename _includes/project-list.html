            <h3 class="project_headline">Operation Broken Silence</h3>
            <p>On Operation Broken Silence, an award-winning site design, I offered creative direction, technical planning and information architecture to create a bold site for a Memphis-based non-profit taking on the genocide in the Sudan. OBS hadn't had a web presence of their own and RocketFuel worked together with them to create a high-class, donor-driven site including interactive infographics and placing their video production skills at the forefront.</p>

            <h3 class="project_headline">Memphis Web Workers</h3>
            <p>As one of two organizers for the Memphis Web Workers -- a user group that meets monthly to discuss design and front-end development -- I tasked myself with creating a new site to meet our growing needs. Originally a basic Wordpress theme, I recreated it as a static site utilizing new CSS techniques and layouts to create a unique experience for Memphis technology groups as befits our status as a design/developer hybrid group. When we started podcasting, I increased the functionality to deal with the added needs. </p>

            <h3 class="project_headline">Memphis Grizzlies Foundation</h3>
            <p>When the Memphis Grizzlies Foundation was in need of a new website, they were also in need of a new site architecture. Through multiple meetings with the client, we worked out a new site map that met their needs and stayed within standards of website conventions. I, then, worked with the RocketFuel design and development to implement an amazing visual design -- with multiple iterations to meet a demanding client's strong aesthetic sense -- and streamlined code -- with an eye toward the client being able to edit content in the custom RocketFuel CMS.</p>
