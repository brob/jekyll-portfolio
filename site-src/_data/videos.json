Literally.\n\nWith all the tools weâ€™re gaining in CSS, designers are going to have new ability to experiment. I wrote about some of those tools on CSS Tricks: Five Design Fears to Vanquish with CSS Grid (https://css-tricks.com/five-design-fears-vanquish-css-grid/).\n\nIâ€™m still convinced that taking inspiration from punk rock design of the 70s and 80s is going to be a trend.\n\nIf you want to start small, introduce some angles to your design. This is a simple trick to angle a stripe of content without adding awkward white space.\n\nIf you're a reader, you can read this as a post over at https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/2018/01/24/tip-use-rotate-and-skew-together-to-introduce-punk-rock-design/\n\nIf you're interested in more CSS content, check out my course Practical CSS Grid: https://store.codecontemporary.com/practical-css-grid\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com\n\n#css #webdesign #csstransform","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIxlqydrRnc","thumbnail":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NIxlqydrRnc/hqdefault.jpg"},{"title":"Getting started with Pseudo Elements (::before and ::after)","description":"Unlike its cousin the pseudo class, a pseudo element is generated in the browser by your CSS.
