CSS has changed. It’s moving away from the mired mess of it’s origin and toward a bright future of interesting layout and easy design.

If you’ve been focused on other important skills in the past 3 years, you’ve missed out on a lot of new, helpful techniques.

This workshop will cover the history of CSS (much like the breakout I’m proposing, as well) and then will go into a deep dive into Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS shapes, Sass, etc. with practical examples and tutorials of each.

This workshop is targeted toward developers who have grown dependent on Bootstrap and Foundation for their CSS knowledge. It’s time to come back into the fold and reclaim the third leg of the basic Web tripod!
