                        <p>OBS hadn't had a web presence of their own and RocketFuel worked together with them to create a high-class, donor-driven site including interactive infographics and placing their video production skills at the forefront.</p>",

                        <p>Originally a basic Wordpress theme, I recreated it as a static site utilizing new CSS techniques and layouts to create a unique experience for Memphis technology groups as befits our status as a design/developer hybrid group. When we started podcasting, I increased the functionality to deal with the added needs. </p>",

                        <p>Then, I worked with the RocketFuel design and development to implement an amazing visual design -- with multiple iterations to meet a demanding client's strong aesthetic sense -- and streamlined code -- with an eye toward the client being able to edit content in the custom RocketFuel CMS.</p>",

We worked through strategy, branding (naming and logo creation) as well as a unique custom development project to create a real-time application in which users can \"draft\" cards from a case broken by TrophyBox.</p>
                        <p>Since finishing the project, Bryce has been able to license the technology to one of the largest case-breaking websites on the market.</p>",

                        <p>While managing the front-end code base, I also worked on the visual design, information architecture and interaction design. I dipped my toes in user testing and helped all 13 news properties utilize their sites via a design framework that allowed them to customize the site, but stay within brand standards.</p>",
