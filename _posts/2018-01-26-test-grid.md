CSS Grid Layout has been in major browsers for a little less than a year now. Despite the excitement around it by people in the know, not everyone has jumped on board.

I understand. Despite its browser adoption happening in record time, we still live in an IE world sometimes.

While 2017 was the year of CSS Grid's browser adoption, 2018 will be the year of its developer adoption.

If you're wondering how to start, here are three strategies for adopting it into your workflow.

## Reduce Excessive Markup

Our appetite for better designs has increased in the past five years. With that -- and our reliance on old layout techniques -- we've seen an explosion in nested markup.

Take this simple promotional grid layout for example.

<img>

To make this happen, we have to introduce a slew of markup to add rows inside of rows.

{% highlight html %}

<section class="flexgrid">

    <div class="left-side">

        <div class="item">1</div>

    </div>

    <div class="right-side">

        <div class="right-top">

            <div class="item">2</div>

        </div>

        <div class="right-bottom">

            <div class="item">3</div>

            <div class="item">4</div>

        </div>

    </div>

</section>

{% endhighlight %}

Keeping track of the nesting is a headache. It also fights against clean, semantic HTML. 

Let's take the same design and build out the HTML we need for CSS Grid.

{% highlight html %}

<section class="grid">

    <div class="grid__item">1</div>

    <div class="grid__item">2</div>

    <div class="grid__item">3</div>

    <div class="grid__item">4</div>

</section>

{% endhighlight %}

With one parent and four direct children, we can pull off uneven rows and columns. 

The promise of Grid Layout is the promise of semantic markup and true separation of concerns.
