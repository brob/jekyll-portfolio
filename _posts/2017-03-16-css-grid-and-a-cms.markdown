description: CSS Grid is coming in Firefox 52 in March. Thatâ€™s amazing. It could overshadow a few small improvements that are also coming in the release. The Box-Alignment module is getting a couple new features, as well.

I love hand crafting layout in CSS Grid. Ask my co-workers. They're tired of hearing about it.

Nothing is going to stop me from hand-coding my CSS. What about people who write no CSS, though? Can we use Grid to open up a world of new layout options to CMS users?

That's not a rhetorical question. I want to hear opinions on this.

I've created a very simple prototype. To all my friends who write good JavaScript, I apologize. Don't look at the JS panel and you'll be happier.

In this example, there are three components on a six-column grid. The doesn't have rows specified, but is adjusting the implicit rows via grid-auto-rows.

With simple markup and ugly JavaScript, I created an interface to let a user select grid areas. Using this interface, a user can take this layout:

![The starting point for the grid](/images/blog/cms-grid/grid-start.jpg)

And change it to these layouts:

As a CSS purist, I'm always wary of ceding my control over to JavaScript or a CMS database. Does this enable a CMS user more interesting controls than otherwise possible?

## Try it for yourself

What do you think? Good idea? Bad idea? Overkill?

Keep in mind before answering, I know that Grid is in its infancy of support. These are important questions for the future.
