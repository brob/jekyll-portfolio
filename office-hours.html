<div class="container--center">
    <p>Looking for a little extra advice on your code? Work better when you collaborate? Need a quick lesson on the latest CSS properties? I'm offering a small window each week for office hours.</p> 

    <p>We'll hop on a quick call/google hangout and talk through any code challenges you've got. </p>
        
    <p>To optimize the time we spend together, I recommend either setting up a <a href="https://codepen.io" alt="CodePen homepage">CodePen</a> or utilizing <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare">VisualStudio Code Live Share</a> so that we can work together on your code.</p>

    <p>Sign up for a time below. Currently, I'm only offering a little bit of time each week, but stay tuned for bigger and better things!</p>
